## Overview

This project is a **VR FPS shooting game** developed using Unreal Engine 5. Rather than simply implementing features, the focus was on adhering to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to reduce the coupling of complex combat systems. By actively utilizing **Observer, Facade, and Component patterns**, I established a stable damage system and AI decision-making structure capable of handling environments where dozens of allies and enemies coexist.

## Tech Stack

* **Game Engine**: Unreal Engine 5 (UE5)
* **AI Architecture**: Behavior Tree, AI Controller
* **Design Patterns**: Observer, Facade, Component Pattern
* **Platform**: Windows (VR Support)
* **Language**: C++, Blueprints

## Key Features

### 1. Pattern-Based Flexible Entity Management
* **Event-Driven Design via Observer Pattern**: Handled health changes and death states without hard-coded references. When damage occurs, events are broadcasted to allow UI updates, animations, and sound effects to react independently.
* **Interface Integration via Facade Pattern**: Encapsulated complex internal logics such as attacking, health checks, and team identification into a single interface. This allows external systems to access data easily without knowing the detailed implementation of the entities.

### 2. Modular Component-Based Damage System
* **Plug-and-Play Structure**: Decoupled damage processing logic into independent components. This allows the damage system to be easily ported to any object—such as players, NPCs, or destructible structures—simply by attaching the component.
* **Projectile-Based Collision Detection**: Bound projectile collision events to calculate accurate hit points and called the `TakeDamage` function to perform reliable physical calculations.

### 3. Hierarchical Behavior Tree AI
* **Tactical Decision Making**: Implemented decision-making logic for both allied and enemy AI using Behavior Trees (BT). Managed states hierarchically from target detection to range-based transitions.
* **Dynamic Distance Control**: Designed organic tactical behavior where AI approaches while firing if the target is beyond `IdleRange`, and performs aiming and stationary fire once within range.

## Technical Challenges & Solutions

### 1. Resolving Tight Coupling Between Objects
* **Issue**: Observed a phenomenon where modifying one unit's code caused cascading errors due to strong dependencies.
* **Solution**: Introduced the **Facade pattern** to abstract core unit functions and utilized the **Component pattern** to build features modularly, removing direct dependencies between classes.
* **Result**: Secured high scalability, allowing the addition of new units or special features without modifying existing code.

### 2. Optimizing Large-Scale AI in VR
* **Issue**: Needed to prevent performance degradation caused by multiple NPCs executing Behavior Trees simultaneously.
* **Solution**: Optimized AI by adjusting the update cycles of sensing logic and managing AI Controller operations asynchronously. Implemented a distance-based tick system to differentiate update frequencies based on proximity to the player.

## Results

* Exhibited and demonstrated at the **2024 Busan-Gyeongnam Game Exhibition (Build 051)**.
* **Achievement**: Successfully proved logical integrity and frame stability in large-scale combat scenarios by organizing complex game logic through design patterns.
